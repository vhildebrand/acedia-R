## Missing/Under-tested Functions:
Functions that should be tested more:
- scalar_mul (only found in implementation, not tests)
- dtype conversion (to_float, to_double, etc.)
- contiguous() method
- clone() method
- tensor slicing with [,] syntax
- broadcasting edge cases
- error conditions and fallbacks

## Redundant Test Areas:
- Non-contiguous operations: 4+ separate test files
- Performance benchmarks: 3 separate files
- GPU verification: duplicated across multiple files
