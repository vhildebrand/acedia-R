\title{acediaR: GPU-Accelerated Computing for R using CUDA}
\description{
Provides CUDA-accelerated linear algebra operations and statistical functions for R, enabling high-performance computing on NVIDIA GPUs. This package implements GPU kernels for common mathematical operations including vector arithmetic, matrix operations, and statistical computations.
}
\details{
The acediaR package provides GPU-accelerated computing capabilities for R using CUDA.
It includes high-performance implementations of common mathematical operations
including vector arithmetic, matrix operations, and statistical computations.

The package provides two main interfaces:
\itemize{
  \item Low-level functions that transfer data to GPU, perform operations, and return to CPU
  \item High-level gpuVector objects that maintain data on GPU for efficient chained operations
}
