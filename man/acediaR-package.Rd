\title{acediaR: GPU-Accelerated Computing for R using CUDA}
\description{
acediaR: R Interface for CUDA-Accelerated Linear Algebra

This package provides CUDA-accelerated linear algebra operations for R,
enabling high-performance GPU computation with familiar R syntax.

The package offers:
\itemize{
  \item High-level functions like \code{gpu_add()}, \code{gpu_multiply()} for simple operations
  \item Advanced gpuTensor objects for complex multi-dimensional operations with mixed precision support
  \item Automatic CPU fallback when GPU is not available
  \item Memory-efficient tensor operations that minimize data transfers
}
}
\details{
The acediaR package provides GPU-accelerated computing capabilities for R using CUDA.
It includes high-performance implementations of common mathematical operations
including vector arithmetic, matrix operations, and statistical computations.

Key features:
\itemize{
  \item Templated CUDA kernels supporting mixed precision (half, float, double)
  \item Unified tensor interface for complex multi-dimensional operations
  \item Efficient memory management with automatic GPU resource cleanup
  \item Comprehensive error handling with graceful CPU fallback
  \item Performance-optimized implementations with parallel reduction algorithms
}

The package is designed for both simple one-off operations and complex 
computational workflows requiring sustained GPU computation.
