# CUDA R Package Development - Sprint Plan

## Project Overview
This document outlines the development plan for implementing CUDA support in R, progressing from basic vector operations to advanced statistical functions implemented as CUDA kernels.

## Sprint Structure
The project is organized into 6 sprints, each building upon the previous work to create a comprehensive GPU-accelerated R package.

---

## Sprint 1: Foundation and Core Infrastructure

**Goal:** Establish the complete project structure, build system, and a proof-of-concept "hello world" test of the R â†’ C++ â†’ CUDA communication pipeline. This sprint is all about making sure the different languages and compilers can talk to each other.

**Deliverables:** A skeleton R package that can be successfully compiled and installed. It will contain one function, `gpu_add()`, that correctly adds two vectors on the GPU. A Git repository will be initialized.

| Task ID | Task Description | Estimated Time | Key Activities |
|---------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1.1 | Project Scaffolding | 2 Days | - Initialize a Git repository<br>- Use `usethis::create_package()` to generate a standard R package structure (R/, src/, man/, DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE)<br>- Populate the DESCRIPTION file with initial package details |
| 1.2 | Build System Configuration | 3 Days | - Create a `src/Makevars` file to define the compilation rules for both C++ (.cpp) and CUDA (.cu) source files<br>- This involves setting flags for the C++ compiler (g++) and the CUDA compiler (nvcc), ensuring they can find R and CUDA headers and libraries<br>- Test the build process with `R CMD INSTALL` |
| 1.3 | Implement Vector Addition | 3 Days | - Place the `vector_add.cu` and `R_interface.cpp` code from the architectural guide into the `src/` directory<br>- Create the user-facing `gpu_add()` R function in a file under the `R/` directory<br>- Add roxygen2 documentation comments to the R function |
| 1.4 | Unit Testing Setup | 2 Days | - Set up the testthat package for unit testing<br>- Write a test script in `tests/testthat/` that validates the correctness of `gpu_add()` by comparing its output to the standard R + operator on large vectors |

---

## Sprint 2: Abstractions and Data Management

**Goal:** Abstract away raw memory management. Create a C++ class to represent a "GPU Vector" that handles its own memory allocation and deallocation, preventing memory leaks and simplifying code.

**Deliverables:** A `gpuVector` C++ class. R functions to create a vector on the GPU (`as.gpuVector()`), pull it back to the CPU (`as.vector()`), and a print method to show a summary. The `gpu_add` function will be refactored to use this new abstraction.

| Task ID | Task Description | Estimated Time | Key Activities |
|---------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 2.1 | Design gpuVector C++ Class | 3 Days | - Define a C++ class to hold a device pointer (`double* d_ptr`), its size, and capacity<br>- Implement a constructor that allocates GPU memory (`cudaMalloc`) and a destructor that frees it (`cudaFree`)<br>- Implement the "Rule of Three/Five" (copy/move constructors, assignment operators) to ensure safe memory handling |
| 2.2 | Integrate with Rcpp | 3 Days | - Introduce the Rcpp package to simplify the R-to-C++ interface layer<br>- Create an Rcpp module to expose the `gpuVector` class to R, allowing R objects to hold pointers to C++ `gpuVector` instances<br>- Implement `as.gpuVector(x)` and `as.vector(gpu_vec)` |
| 2.3 | Refactor gpu_add | 2 Days | - Modify the `gpu_add` function and its backend C++ code to operate on `gpuVector` objects instead of raw pointers<br>- The R function signature will become `gpu_add(gpu_vec_a, gpu_vec_b)` |
| 2.4 | Documentation & Testing | 2 Days | - Document the new `as.gpuVector` and related functions<br>- Add testthat tests for the new data transfer and refactored addition functions |

---

## Sprint 3: Foundational Operations (BLAS Level 1)

**Goal:** Implement fundamental element-wise and vector-wide operations. This will establish a pattern for adding new computational kernels to the library.

**Deliverables:** GPU-accelerated functions for scalar multiplication (`a * x`), element-wise multiplication (`x * y`), and dot product.

| Task ID | Task Description | Estimated Time | Key Activities |
|---------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 3.1 | Element-wise & Scalar Ops | 4 Days | - Write new CUDA kernels for element-wise multiplication and scalar multiplication<br>- Implement the corresponding C++/Rcpp interface and user-facing R functions<br>- Overload the `*` operator in R for `gpuVector` objects to provide a natural syntax |
| 3.2 | Dot Product (Reduction) | 4 Days | - Research and implement an efficient parallel reduction algorithm in CUDA to calculate the dot product. This is a key parallel programming pattern<br>- The kernel will likely use shared memory for performance<br>- Implement the R function `gpu_dot(vec_a, vec_b)` |
| 3.3 | Testing & Benchmarking | 2 Days | - Write comprehensive unit tests for all new operations, checking for correctness against base R<br>- Create an initial benchmark script to compare the performance of the GPU functions vs. their CPU counterparts |

---

## Sprint 4: Matrix Support

**Goal:** Extend the data abstractions to include matrices. This is a critical step towards more advanced linear algebra.

**Deliverables:** A `gpuMatrix` C++ class. R functions `as.gpuMatrix()`, `as.matrix()`, and element-wise matrix addition/multiplication.

| Task ID | Task Description | Estimated Time | Key Activities |
|---------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 4.1 | Design gpuMatrix Class | 3 Days | - Design a C++ class similar to `gpuVector`, but storing rows and columns<br>- Ensure data is stored in column-major order to match R's default matrix layout<br>- Implement memory management and data transfer methods (`to_device`, `to_host`) |
| 4.2 | R Interface for Matrices | 3 Days | - Use Rcpp to create `as.gpuMatrix(mat)` and `as.matrix(gpu_mat)`<br>- Implement a print method that shows matrix dimensions and a preview of the data |
| 4.3 | Element-wise Matrix Kernels | 3 Days | - Write 2D CUDA kernels for element-wise matrix addition and multiplication<br>- The kernels will use a 2D grid of thread blocks to map naturally to the matrix structure<br>- Overload `+` and `*` operators for `gpuMatrix` objects |
| 4.4 | Testing and Integration | 1 Day | - Add testthat scripts for all new matrix functionality<br>- Ensure the build system correctly compiles and links all new source files |

## Sprint 5: Advanced Linear Algebra (BLAS Level 2 & 3)

**Goal:** Implement the workhorses of numerical computing: matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplication. Performance is key here.

**Deliverables:** Highly optimized functions `gpu_matvec_mult(mat, vec)` and `gpu_matmul(mat_a, mat_b)`.

| Task ID | Task Description | Estimated Time | Key Activities |
|---------|------------------|----------------|----------------|

| 5.2 | Matrix-Matrix Multiplication | 5 Days | - Implement a high-performance tiled matrix multiplication kernel using shared memory to maximize data reuse and minimize global memory access<br>- This is a canonical CUDA optimization problem<br>- Overload `%*%` for `gpuMatrix` operands |
| 5.3 | Performance Profiling | 1 Day | - Use NVIDIA's nvprof or Nsight Compute to profile the `gpu_matmul` kernel<br>- Analyze the results to identify and potentially fix performance bottlenecks |

---

## Sprint 6: Polish, Documentation, and Release Preparation

**Goal:** Prepare the package for an initial alpha release (v0.1.0). The focus shifts from feature development to stability, usability, and documentation.

**Deliverables:** A package vignette, comprehensive function documentation, robust error handling, and a clean `R CMD check` report.

| Task ID | Task Description | Estimated Time | Key Activities |
|---------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 6.1 | Robust Error Handling | 3 Days | - Implement a C++ macro or function (e.g., `cudaSafeCall`) to wrap all CUDA API calls, check for errors, and report them back to the R user in a clear, understandable way<br>- Add input validation to R functions (e.g., check for conformable dimensions in matrix multiplication) |
| 6.2 | Write Package Vignette | 4 Days | - Create an R Markdown vignette (.Rmd) in the `vignettes/` directory<br>- The vignette should serve as a tutorial, introducing the package's purpose, demonstrating its usage with examples, and showcasing performance gains |
| 6.3 | Finalize Documentation | 2 Days | - Perform a full review of all roxygen2 documentation<br>- Run `devtools::document()` to generate all `.Rd` help files<br>- Create a `NEWS.md` file to track changes |
